# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### 🚀 Features

- #76, clarify search results
- #52, search by genre
- Add entire genre; show item counts in queue and genre columns

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- User interactions in search page with no results resulting in NPE. (#79)
- Some (optional?) attributes are provided with different types by gonic and navidrome, which breaks json unmarshalling. To support this, a custom unmarshaller will have to be written; in the meantime, to prevent panics, the attributes have been removed. We aren't using them (yet) anyway.
- Issue #88, duplicate key binding for "scan" and "save queue as playlist"
- Lyrics for songs were being loaded in the wrong place, and so weren't updating from song to song unless the album art also changed.
- Clarifies search help text
- During the merge, a field rename prevented unmarshalling of search results
- Search page apropos focus now focuses appropriately
- Queue page root was being created twice, and the second time omitted the song info, causing it to not be shown until the user toggled it on

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fix if cond
- Typo

### Add

- Fetch version information from build info
- Search now pro-actively searches until no more results are returned. It still queries in batches of 20, and updates the list(s) as results are available.

### Adds

- Ability to toggle song info panel on queue page via `i` (courtesy of @mahmed2000)

### Change

- Re-arranges the song info; purely aesthic chang (#81)
- Browser now works on metadata, not directory structure. Not all functions fully tested, but it works.
- Tweaks the lyrics timing offset to try to hit that sweet spot that makes up for the inaccuracy of mpv
- Rolls back the (unrelated, unnecessary) logger changes
